# NLP-Projects

I study NLP through books and papers in my free time. I'm going to put my projects' sourse code in this repository. The codes I put here are 95% written by me. I hope thay would be useful for you :)

## Some of the main resources I'm using :

[Speech and Language Processing](https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/) : for learning NLP consepts

[Natural Language Processing with PyTorch](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/natural-language-processing/9781491978221/) : for learning the structure of NLP projects' code and NLP consepts

[Natural Language Processing Projects](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/natural-language-processing/9781484273869/) : for getting ideas of NLP applications and projects
