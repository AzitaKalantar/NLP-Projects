### version1_embedded_rnn :
in this version of the code I used a pretrained embeddeding named [GloVe](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/) as the initial weights for my embedding layer.I also used a GRU layer as my RNN layer to give an importance to the sequence of words rather than just the exsistance of words in each sentence.
